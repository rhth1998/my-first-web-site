 <p>B cells are important in the pathogenesis of many, and perhaps all, immune-mediated diseases. Each B cell expresses a single B cell receptor (BCR), and the diverse range of BCRs expressed by the total B cell population of an individual is termed the ‘BCR repertoire’. Our understanding of the BCR repertoire in the context of immune-mediated diseases is incomplete, and defining this could provide new insights into pathogenesis and therapy.<p/>

<p style="margin-top:10px;"> During the development of B cells in the bone marrow (or fetal liver), recombination of immunoglobulin genes forms the ‘naive’ BCR repertoire, which is modified by the removal or suppression of self-reactive B cells to reduce the chance of autoimmune disease3 (although 20–40% of B cells remain autoreactive4). Further diversification of the repertoire occurs after B cells respond to antigen. Many B cells undergo ‘isotype switching’, in which stepwise DNA deletion and recombination from immunoglobulin M (IgM) generates downstream isotypes (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2, IgD and IgE) that confer distinct functional characteristics and roles in disease. Delineation of isotypes is thus vital for a full analysis of the BCR repertoire. Further diversification of BCRs occurs in specialized germinal centres, in which somatic hypermutation (SHM) of genes that encode the variable (V) regions of antibodies may enhance BCR affinity and specificity. This diversification of B cell clones after exposure to antigen is tempered by tolerance checkpoints to reduce the risk of autoimmunity. The peripheral BCR repertoire is thus a composite of both the naive repertoire and that generated by antigenic encounter.</p>
